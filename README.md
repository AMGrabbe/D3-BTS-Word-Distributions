# Showing BTS word distributions in D3 chart
For this project I picked 5 of my favorite BTS songs to show for each the amount of word sung by each member. 

## Preparations
### Data
I searched the internet for the respective song's lyrics which also had some annotations about who is singing the lines. *(No, I cannot determine who is singing only by hearing the song* >.<)
